# Commonalities
Repository to describe and document common guidelines and assets for CAMARA APIs

## Scope
* Guidelines and assets for “Commonalities” (see APIBacklog.md)  
* All deliverables are mandatory for all CAMARA Sub Projects 
* Describe, develop, document and test the deliverables
* Started: October 2021

## Documents for CAMARA Sub Projects

The documents that are relevant for CAMARA API Repositories are found in the `documentation` directory (at the top-level). The rest of the sub-directories are primarily for internal working of the Commonalities Working Group.

The `artifacts` directory contains:
* templates for creating Github issues
* common data and error formats for CAMARA APIs in [CAMARA_common.yaml](artifacts/CAMARA_common.yaml)
* notification subscription template: [event-subscription-template.yaml](artifacts/camara-cloudevents/event-subscription-template.yaml)
* OAS definition of CAMARA Event using CloudEvents: [notification-as-cloud-event.yaml](artifacts/notification-as-cloud-event.yaml)
* Common artifacts for testing error scenarios for device and phoneNumber: in [artifacts/testing](artifacts/testing) folder
