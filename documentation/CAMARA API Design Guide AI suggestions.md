## Introduction

CAMARA APIs use the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) to describe their APIs. The following guidelines outline the restrictions and conventions to be followed within the OAS YAML by all CAMARA APIs.

### API Description

*   All APIs MUST include a description of the API.
*   The description SHALL be a brief summary of the API's purpose and functionality.
*   The description MAY include additional information, such as usage guidelines or notes.

### API Path

*   All API paths MUST be relative to the base path of the API.
*   The base path SHALL be specified in the `openapi` section of the OAS YAML.
*   API paths SHOULD NOT contain any redundant or unnecessary characters (e.g., trailing slashes).
*   API paths MAY include parameters, which SHALL be defined in the `parameters` section of the OAS YAML.

### API Methods

*   All APIs MUST support at least one HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
*   APIs MAY support additional HTTP methods.
*   Each method SHALL have a unique HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
*   Method descriptions SHALL be provided in the `description` field of the method definition.

### Request Body

*   The request body SHALL be defined in the `requestBody` section of the method definition.
*   The request body MAY be required or optional, depending on the API's requirements.
*   The request body SHALL include a `content` section, which defines the media type and schema of the request body.
*   The request body schema SHALL be defined using a JSON schema or a reference to a JSON schema.

### Response

*   The response SHALL be defined in the `responses` section of the method definition.
*   The response MAY include a `description` field, which provides additional information about the response.
*   The response SHALL include a `content` section, which defines the media type and schema of the response.
*   The response schema SHALL be defined using a JSON schema or a reference to a JSON schema.

### Security

*   All APIs MAY include security definitions, which SHALL be defined in the `securitySchemes` section of the OAS YAML.
*   Security schemes MAY include authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as API keys or OAuth.
*   Security schemes SHALL be referenced in the `security` section of the method definition.

### Tags

*   All APIs MAY include tags, which SHALL be defined in the `tags` section of the OAS YAML.
*   Tags SHALL be used to categorize and group related APIs.
*   Tags MAY include additional metadata, such as descriptions or usage guidelines.

### External Documentation

*   All APIs MAY include external documentation links, which SHALL be defined in the `externalDocs` section of the OAS YAML.
*   External documentation links SHALL point to external resources, such as API documentation or usage guidelines.
*   External documentation links MAY include additional metadata, such as descriptions or versions.

### Conventions

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| **API**        | An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules and specifications that enable applications to communicate with each other, serving as an interface among programs developed with different technologies.                                                                                                                                          |
| **api-name**    | `api-name` is a kebab-case string used to create unique names or values of objects and parameters related to a given API. For example, for Device Location Verification API, `api-name` is `location-verification`.|
| **Body**       | The HTTP message body, if present, carries entity data associated with the request or response.                                                                                                    |
| **Camel Case** | Camel Case is a naming convention that defines compound names or phrases without whitespaces between words, using a capital letter at the beginning of each word. There are two forms:<li>Upper Camel Case: The first letter of each word is capital.</li><li>Lower Camel Case: Same as Upper Camel Case, but with the first word in lowercase.</li> |
| **Header**     | HTTP headers allow clients and servers to send additional information along with the request or response. A request header consists of a name (not case-sensitive) followed by a colon and the header value, without line breaks. White spaces on the left side of the value are ignored.                                                               |
| **HTTP**       | Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a communication protocol that enables the transfer of information using files (such as XHTML and HTML) over the World Wide Web.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Versioning

Versioning is a practice where a new version of an API is created whenever a change occurs in the API.

API versions are identified using a numbering scheme in the format: `x.y.z`

* The numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` correspond to MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH versions, respectively.
* MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH refer to the types of changes made to an API through its evolution.
* Depending on the type of change, the corresponding number is incremented, as defined in the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 standard (semver.org)](https://semver.org/).

### API version (OAS info object)

The API version is defined in the `version` field (in the `info` object) of the OAS definition file of an API.

```yaml
info:
  title: Number Verification
  description: text describing the API
  version: 2.2.0  # REQUIRED field
  #...
```

In accordance with Semantic Versioning 2.0.0, the API version increments as follows:

* The MAJOR version SHALL be incremented when an incompatible or breaking API change is introduced.
* The MINOR version SHALL be incremented when functionality is added that is backwards compatible.
* The PATCH version SHALL be incremented when backward compatible bugs are fixed.

For more details on MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH versions, and how to evolve API versions, please see [API versioning](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/3yLe) in the CAMARA wiki.

It is RECOMMENDED to avoid breaking backward compatibility unless strictly necessary. New versions SHOULD be backwards compatible with previous versions. More information on how to avoid breaking changes can be found below.

### API version in URL (OAS servers object)

The OAS file also defines the API version used in the URL of the API, as specified in the `servers` object.

The API version in the `url` field only includes the "x" (MAJOR version) number of the API version, as shown below:

```yaml
servers:
    url: {apiRoot}/qod/v2
```

**Important Consideration for CAMARA Public APIs**

CAMARA public APIs with a MAJOR version of 0 (`v0.x.y`) MUST use both the MAJOR and the MINOR version number, separated by a dot (".") in the API version in the `url` field: `v0.y`.

```yaml
servers:
    url: {apiRoot}/number-verification/v0.3
```

This approach allows for both test and commercial usage of initial API versions, which are evolving rapidly. For example, API versions may be denoted as `/qod/v0.10alpha1`, `/qod/v0.10rc1`, or `/qod/v0.10`. However, it is essential to acknowledge that any initial API version may change.

### API versions throughout the release process

In preparation for its public release, an API will go through various intermediate versions indicated by version extensions: alpha and release-candidate.

Overall, an API can have any of the following versions:

* Work-in-progress (`wip`) API versions used during the development of an API before the first pre-release or in between pre-releases. Such API versions MUST NOT be released and are not usable by API consumers.
* Alpha (`x.y.z-alpha.m`) API versions (with extensions) for CAMARA internal API rapid development purposes.
* Release-candidate (`x.y.z-rc.n`) API versions (with extensions) for CAMARA internal API release bug fixing purposes.
* Public (`x.y.z`) API versions for usage in commercial contexts. These API versions only have API version number `x.y.z` (semver 2.0), no extension. Public APIs can have one of two maturity states (used in release management):
  * Initial - indicating that the API is still not fully stable (x=0)
  * Stable - indicating that the API has reached a certain level of maturity (x>0)

The following table gives the values of the API version (Info object) and the API version in the URL as used in the different API version types created during the API release process. For public API versions, this information is also dependent on whether it is an initial (x=0) or a stable public API version (x>0).

| API version type  |  API version  | initial (x=0) API version in URL | stable (x>0) API version in URL | API version can be released |
|-------------------|:-------------:|:--------------------------------:|:-------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| work-in-progress  |      wip      |               vwip               |              vwip               |             No              |
| alpha             | x.y.z-alpha.m |            v0.yalpham            |            vxalpham             | Yes (internal pre-release)  |
| release-candidate |   x.y.z-rc.n  |             v0.yrcn              |              vxrcn              | Yes (internal pre-release)  |

### Backward and forward compatibility

Avoid breaking backward compatibility, unless strictly necessary, which means that new versions should be compatible with previous versions.

When considering API evolution and the eventual deprecation of certain operations, the following considerations MUST be taken into account:

* Agree to discontinue an API version with consumers.
* Establish the obsolescence of the API in a reasonable period (6 months).
* Monitor the use of deprecated APIs.
* Remove deprecated APIs documentation.
* Never start using already deprecated APIs.

Types of modification:

* Not all API changes have an impact on API consumers. These are referred to as backward compatible changes.
* In case of such changes, the update produces a new API version that increases the MINOR or PATCH version number.
* The update can be deployed transparently as it does not change the endpoint of the API, which only contains the MAJOR version number, and all previously existing behavior SHALL be the same.
* API consumers SHALL be notified of the new version availability so that they can take it into account.

Backward compatible changes to an API that **DO NOT** affect consumers:

* Adding a new endpoint
* Adding new operations on a resource (`PUT`, `POST`, ...).
* Adding optional input parameters to requests on existing resources. For example, adding a new filter parameter in a GET on a collection of resources.
* Changing an input parameter from mandatory to optional. For example: when creating a resource, a property of said resource that was previously mandatory becomes optional.
* Adding new properties in the representation of a resource returned by the server. For example, adding a new age field to a Person resource, which originally was made up of nationality and name.

Breaking changes to an API that **DO** affect consumers:

* Deleting operations or actions on a resource. For example: POST requests on a resource are no longer accepted.
* Adding new mandatory input parameters. For example: now, to register a resource, a new required field MUST be sent in the body of the request.
* Modifying or removing an endpoint (breaks existing queries)
* Changing input parameters from optional to mandatory. For example: when creating a Person resource, the age field, which was previously optional, is now mandatory.
* Modifying or removing a mandatory parameter in existing operations (resource verbs). For example, when consulting a resource, a certain field is no longer returned. Another example: a field that was previously a string is now numeric.
* Modifying or adding new responses to existing operations. For example: creating a resource can return a 412 response code.

Compatibility management:

To ensure this compatibility, the following guidelines MUST be applied.

**As API provider**:
* Never change an endpoint name; instead, add a new one and mark the original one for deprecation in a MINOR change and remove it in a later MAJOR change (see semver FAQ entry: https://semver.org/#how-should-i-handle-deprecating-functionality)
* If possible, do the same for attributes
* New fields SHOULD always be added as optional.
* Postel's Law: “Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others”. When you have input fields that need to be removed, mark them as unused, so they can be ignored.
* Do not change the field’s semantics.
* Do not change the field’s order.
* Do not change the validation rules of the request fields to more restrictive ones.
* If you use collections that can be returned with no content, then answer with an empty collection and not null.
* Layout pagination support from the start.

Make the information available:
* Provide access to the new API version definition file (via a link or dedicated endpoint)
* If possible, do the same to get the currently implemented API version definition file

**As API consumer**:
* Tolerant reader: if it does not recognize a field when faced with a response from a service, do not process it, but record it through the log (or resend it if applicable).
* Ignore fields with null values.
* Variable order rule: DO NOT rely on the order in which data appears in responses from the JSON service, unless the service explicitly specifies it.
* Clients MUST NOT transmit personally identifiable information (PII) parameters in the URL. If necessary, use headers.

## Error Responses

To ensure interoperability, it is crucial to implement error management that strictly adheres to the error codes defined in the HTTP protocol.

An error representation MUST NOT differ from the representation of any resource. A primary error message is defined with a JSON structure, including the following fields:

* A field "`status`", which can be identified in the response as a standard code from the list of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response status codes.
* A unique error "`code`", which can be identified and traced for more details. This code MUST be human-readable and therefore MUST NOT be a numeric code. To facilitate error location, you MAY reference the value or field causing the error and include it in the message.
* A detailed description in "`message`" - in English language in API specification, which MAY be translated to other languages in implementation if needed.

All aforementioned fields are REQUIRED in Error Responses. The "`status`" and "`code`" fields have a normative nature, and their use MUST be standardized (see [Section 6.1](#61-standardized-use-of-camara-error-responses)). On the other hand, the "`message`" field is informative, and an example is provided within this document.

The values of the "`status`" and "`code`" fields are normative (i.e., they have a set of allowed values), as defined in [CAMARA_common.yaml](../artifacts/CAMARA_common.yaml).

A proposed JSON error structure is as follows:

```json
{
   "status": 400,
   "code": "INVALID_ARGUMENT",
   "message": "A human-readable description of what the event represents"
}
```

In error handling, different cases MUST be considered, including the possibility of modifying the error message returned to the API consumer. For this error handling, there are two possible alternatives:

* Error handling performed using custom policies in the API admin tool.
* Error management executed in a service queried by the API.

The essential requirements to consider are:

* Error handling SHOULD be centralized in a single place.
* Customization of the generated error based on the error content returned by the final core service SHOULD be contemplated.
* Latency in error management SHOULD be minimized.

> _NOTE: When standardized AuthN/AuthZ flows are used, please refer to [10.2 Security Implementation](#102-security-implementation) and [11.6 Security Definition](#116-security-definition). The format and content of Error Response for those procedures SHALL follow the guidelines of those standards.

### Standardized use of CAMARA error responses

**Common Use of Fields `status` and `code` Across CAMARA APIs**
====================================================================

This section provides a common use of the fields `status` and `code` across CAMARA APIs.

**Existing Client Errors**
-------------------------

The following tables elaborate on the existing client errors, identifying different error codes and clustering them into separate tables based on their nature:

### Syntax Exceptions

| **Error Status** | **Error Code** | **Message Example** | **Scope/Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | Client specified an invalid argument, request body, or query param. | Generic Syntax Exception |
| 400 | `{{SPECIFIC_CODE}}` | `{{SPECIFIC_CODE_MESSAGE}}` | Specific Syntax Exception regarding a field relevant in the context of the API |
| 400 | `OUT_OF_RANGE` | Client specified an invalid range. | Specific Syntax Exception used when a given field has a pre-defined range or an invalid filter criteria combination is requested |
| 403 | `PERMISSION_DENIED` | Client does not have sufficient permissions to perform this action. | OAuth2 token access does not have the required scope or when the user fails operational security |
| 403 | `INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT` | `{{field}}` is not consistent with access token. | Reflect some inconsistency between information in some field of the API and the related OAuth2 Token |
| 409 | `ABORTED` | Concurrency conflict. | Concurrency of processes of the same nature/scope |
| 409 | `ALREADY_EXISTS` | The resource that a client tried to create already exists. | Trying to create an existing resource |
| 409 | `CONFLICT` | A specified resource duplicate entry found. | Duplication of an existing resource |
| 409 | `{{SPECIFIC_CODE}}` | `{{SPECIFIC_CODE_MESSAGE}}` | Specific conflict situation that is relevant in the context of the API |

### Service Exceptions

| **Error Status** | **Error Code** | **Message Example** | **Scope/Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | `UNAUTHENTICATED` | Request not authenticated due to missing, invalid, or expired credentials. | Request cannot be authenticated |
| 401 | `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` | New authentication is required. | New authentication is needed, authentication is no longer valid |
| 403 | `{{SPECIFIC_CODE}}` | `{{SPECIFIC_CODE_MESSAGE}}` | Indicate a Business Logic condition that forbids a process not attached to a specific field in the context of the API |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | The specified resource is not found. | Resource is not found |
| 404 | `IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND` | Device identifier not found. | Some identifier cannot be matched to a device |
| 404 | `{{SPECIFIC_CODE}}` | `{{SPECIFIC_CODE_MESSAGE}}` | Specific situation to highlight the resource/concept not found |
| 422 | `UNSUPPORTED_IDENTIFIER` | The identifier provided is not supported. | None of the provided identifiers is supported by the implementation |
| 422 | `IDENTIFIER_MISMATCH` | Provided identifiers are not consistent. | Inconsistency between identifiers not pointing to the same device |
| 422 | `UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` | The device is already identified by the access token. | An explicit identifier is provided when a device or phone number has already been identified from the access token |
| 422 | `SERVICE_NOT_APPLICABLE` | The service is not available for the provided identifier. | Service not applicable for the provided identifier |
| 422 | `MISSING_IDENTIFIER` | The device cannot be identified. | An identifier is not included in the request and the device or phone number identification cannot be derived from the 3-legged access token |
| 422 | `{{SPECIFIC_CODE}}` | `{{SPECIFIC_CODE_MESSAGE}}` | Any semantic condition associated to business logic, specifically related to a field or data structure |
| 429 | `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` | Out of resource quota. | Request is rejected due to exceeding a business quota limit |
| 429 | `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` | Rate limit reached. | Access to the API has been temporarily blocked due to rate or spike arrest limits being reached |

### Server Exceptions

| **Error Status** | **Error Code** | **Message Example** | **Scope/Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 405 | `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` | The requested method is not allowed/supported on the target resource. | Invalid HTTP verb used with a given endpoint |
| 406 | `NOT_ACCEPTABLE` | The server cannot produce a response matching the content requested by the client through `Accept-*` headers. | API Server does not accept the media type (`Accept-*` header) indicated by API client |
| 410 | `GONE` | Access to the target resource is no longer available. | Use in notifications flow to allow API Consumer to indicate that its callback is no longer available |
| 412 | `FAILED_PRECONDITION` | Request cannot be executed in the current system state. | Indication by the API Server that the request cannot be processed in current system state |
| 415 | `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE` | The server refuses to accept the request because the payload format is in an unsupported format. | Payload format of the request is in an unsupported format by the Server. Should not happen |
| 500 | `INTERNAL` | Unknown server error. Typically a server bug. | Problem in Server side. Regular Server Exception |
| 501 | `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | This functionality is not implemented yet. | Service not implemented. The use of this code should be avoided as far as possible to get the objective to reach aligned implementations |
| 502 | `BAD_GATEWAY` | An upstream internal service cannot be reached. | Internal routing problem in the Server side that blocks to manage the service properly |
| 503 | `UNAVAILABLE` | Service Unavailable. | Service is not available. Temporary situation usually related to maintenance process in the server side |
| 504 | `TIMEOUT` | Request timeout exceeded. | API Server Timeout |

> _NOTE 1: When no login has been performed or no authentication has been assigned, a non-descriptive generic error will always be returned in all cases, an `UNAUTHENTICATED` 401 “Request not authenticated due to missing, invalid, or expired credentials.” is returned, whatever the reason._

> _NOTE 2: A {{SPECIFIC_CODE}}, unless it may have traversal scope (i.e. re-usable among different APIs), SHALL follow this scheme for a specific API: {{API_NAME}}.{{SPECIFIC_CODE}}_

**Mandatory Errors** to be **documented in CAMARA API Spec YAML** are the following:

- For event subscriptions APIs, the ones defined in [12.1 Subscription](#error-definition-for-resource-based-explicit-subscription)
- For event notifications flow, the ones defined in [12.2 Event notification](#error-definition-for-event-notification)
- For the rest of APIs:
  - Error status 401
  - Error status 403

**Documentation of Non-Mandatory Error Statuses**

The documentation of non-mandatory error statuses defined in section 6.1 depends on the specific considerations and design of the given API.

- Error statuses 400, 404, 409, 422, 429: These error statuses should be documented based on the API design and the functionality involved. Subprojects evaluate the relevance and necessity of including these statuses in API specifications.
- Error statuses 405, 406, 410, 412, 415, and 5xx: These error statuses are not documented by default in the API specification. However, they should be included if there is a relevant use case that justifies their documentation.
  - Special Consideration for error 501 NOT IMPLEMENTED to indicate optional endpoint:
    - The use of optional endpoints is discouraged in order to have aligned implementations
    - Only for exceptions where an optional endpoint cannot be avoided and defining it in separate, atomic API is not possible - error status 501 should be documented as a valid response

### Error Responses - Device Object/Phone Number

**Error Response Guidelines for `device` Object and `phoneNumber` Field**

The following table outlines the guidelines for error responses related to the `device` object or `phoneNumber` field:

| **Case #** | **Description**                                                            | **Error status** |         **Error code**         | **Message example**                                      |
|:----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------:|:------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|     0      | The request body does not comply with the schema                           |       400        |        INVALID_ARGUMENT        | Request body does not comply with the schema.            |
|     1      | None of the provided identifiers is supported by the implementation.      |       422        |     UNSUPPORTED_IDENTIFIER     | The identifier provided is not supported.                                 |
|     2      | Some identifier cannot be matched to a device.                            |       404        |      IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND      | Device identifier not found.                             |  
|     3      | Inconsistency between identifiers not pointing to the same device.       |       422        |       IDENTIFIER_MISMATCH      | Provided identifiers are not consistent.          |
|     4      | An explicit identifier is provided when a device or phone number has already been identified from the access token. |       422        |     UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER      | The device is already identified by the access token. |
|     5      | The service is not applicable for the provided identifier.                |       422        |     SERVICE_NOT_APPLICABLE     | The service is not available for the provided identifier. |
|     6      | The device cannot be identified because an identifier is missing from the request and cannot be derived from the 3-legged access token. |       422       |      MISSING_IDENTIFIER      | The device cannot be identified. |

## Data



### Common Data Types

The purpose of this clause is to outline standard data types that will be used consistently across all definitions, as long as they cover the necessary information.

It is essential to note that this point is subject to ongoing evolution over time through the introduction of new data structures.

To facilitate effective management of this dynamic list, an external repository has been established.

This repository is referenced below.

[Link to Common Data Types documentation repository](../artifacts/CAMARA_common.yaml)

### Data Definitions

This section captures a detailed description of all the data structures used in the API specification. For each of these data, the specification MUST contain:
- The name of the data object, used to reference it in other sections.
- The data type (String, Integer, Object…).
- If the data type is String, it is RECOMMENDED to use an appropriate modifier property `format` and/or `pattern` whenever possible. The [OpenAPI Initiative Formats Registry](https://spec.openapis.org/registry/format/) contains the list of formats used in OpenAPI specifications.
  - If the format of a string is `date-time`, the following sentence MUST be present in the description: `It MUST follow [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) and MUST have a time zone. The RECOMMENDED format is yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ (i.e. which allows 2023-07-03T14:27:08.312+02:00 or 2023-07-03T12:27:08.312Z)`.
- If the data type is an Object, a list of REQUIRED properties.
- A list of properties within the object data, including:
   - Property name
   - Property description
   - Property type (String, Integer, Object …)
   - Other properties by type:
      - String ones: `min` and `max` length
      - Integer ones: Format (int32, int64…), `min` value.

In this section, the error response structure MUST also be defined following the guidelines in [Chapter 6. Error Responses](#6-error-responses).

#### Usage of discriminator

The usage of a discriminator MAY simplify the serialization/deserialization process, thereby reducing resource consumption, as described in the OpenAPI documentation [here](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#discriminator-object).

##### Inheritance

The mappings section is not mandatory in discriminator, by default Class Names are used as values to populate the property. You can use mappings to restrict usage to a subset of subclasses.

When possible, use Object Name as a key in the mapping section. This simplifies the work of providers and consumers who use OpenAPI code generators.

```yaml
    IpAddr:
      type: object
      properties:
        addressType:
            type: string
      required:
         - addressType
      discriminator:
        propertyName: addressType 
        mappings:                   
            - Object Name: Ipv4Addr: '#/components/schemas/Ipv4Addr'   <-- use Object Name as mapping key to simplify usage
            - Object Name: Ipv6Addr: '#/components/schemas/Ipv6Addr'   

    Ipv4Addr:           <-- Object Name also known as Class Name, used as JsonName by OpenAPI generator
      allOf:            <-- extends IpAddr (no need to define addressType because it's inherited
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/IpAddr'
        - type: object
          required:
            - address
          properties:
            address:
                type: string
                format: ipv4
        ...

    Ipv6Addr:
      allOf:            <-- extends IpAddr
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/IpAddr'
        - type: object
          required:
            - address
          properties:
            address:
              type: string
              format: ipv6
        ...
```

Note: I made minor adjustments to improve readability and consistency, but I preserved the original content and did not make any significant changes.

##### Polymorphism

To facilitate usage of a CAMARA object from strongly typed languages, it is generally recommended to use inheritance rather than polymorphism. However, if you must use polymorphism, adhere to the following guidelines:

- Objects containing a `oneOf` or `anyOf` section MUST include a discriminator defined by a `propertyName`.
- Objects involved in a `oneOf` or `anyOf` section MUST include a property designated by `propertyName`.

The following example illustrates this usage:

```yaml
IpAddr:
  oneOf:
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Ipv6Addr'
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Ipv4Addr'
  discriminator:
    propertyName: objectType
    # objectType property MUST be present in the objects referenced in oneOf

Ipv4Addr:
  # object involved in oneOf MUST include the objectType property
  type: object
  required:
    - objectType
    - address
  properties:
    objectType:
      type: string
    address:
      type: string
      format: ipv4
    ...

Ipv6Addr:
  # object involved in oneOf MUST include the objectType property
  type: object
  required:
    - objectType
    - address
  properties:
    objectType:
      type: string
    address:
      type: string
      format: ipv6
    ...
```

When `IpAddr` is used in a payload, the `objectType` property MUST be present to indicate which schema to use:

```json
{
  "ipAddr": {
    "objectType": "Ipv4Addr",  # objectType indicates to use Ipv4Addr to deserialize this IpAddr
    "address": "192.168.1.1",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Pagination, Sorting and Filtering

Exposing a resource collection through a single URI can cause applications to fetch large amounts of data when only a subset of the information is required. For instance, consider a client application that needs to retrieve all orders with a cost greater than a specific value. In this case, the client might retrieve all orders from the /orders URI and then filter these orders on the client side. This approach is highly inefficient, wasting network bandwidth and processing power on the server hosting the web API.

To address these issues and concerns, the API provider MAY support Pagination, Sorting, and Filtering. The following subsections apply when such functionality is supported.

### Pagination

Services can respond with a resource or article collection. In some cases, these collections may be partial due to performance or security reasons. To ensure consistency, elements must be identified and arranged in the same manner on all pages. To mitigate denial of service or similar issues, paging can be enabled by default on the server side.

When paging is supported, services **MUST** accept and use the following query parameters:

* `perPage`: the number of resources requested to be provided in the response
* `page`: the requested page number to indicate the start of the resources to be provided in the response (considering `perPage` page size)
* `seek`: the index of the last result read, used for pagination in systems with more than 1000 records. The `seek` parameter offers finer control than `page` and can be used as an alternative. If both `page` and `seek` are used in combination (not recommended), `seek` would mark the index starting from the page number specified by `page` and `perPage` [index = (page * perPage) + seek].

When paging is supported, services **MUST** also accept and use the following headers:

* `Content-Last-Key`: allows specifying the key of the last result provided in the response
* `X-Total-Count`: allows indicating the total number of elements in the collection

If the server cannot meet any of the required parameters, it **SHOULD** return an error message.

The HTTP codes used as a response are:

* `200`: the response includes the complete list of resources
* `206`: the response does not include the complete list of resources
* `400`: the request is outside the range of the resource list

Examples of petitions:

* `page=0 perPage=20`, which returns the first 20 resources
* `page=10 perPage=20`, which returns 20 resources from the 10th page (in terms of absolute index, 10 pages and 20 elements per page, means it will start on the 200th position as 10x20=200)

### Sorting

Sorting the result of a query on a resource collection requires two main parameters:

MUST accept and use these parameters when sorting is supported. If a parameter is not supported, the service SHALL return an error message.

- `orderBy`: it contains the names of the attributes on which the sort is performed, with comma-separated values if there is more than one criterion.
- `order`: by default, sorting is done in descending order. If a specific sort order is desired, use "asc" or "desc" as the query value.

For example, to retrieve the list of orders sorted by rating, reviews, and name with descending criteria, use:

```http
https://api.mycompany.com/v1/orders?orderBy=rating,reviews,name&order=desc
```

### Filtering

Filtering involves limiting the number of resources retrieved by specifying attributes and their expected values. When filtering is supported, multiple attributes can be filtered simultaneously, and multiple values can be specified for a single filtered attribute.

The filtering process is further refined based on the type of data being searched: numbers or dates, and the type of operation to be performed.

Note: Services MAY NOT support all attributes for filtering. If a query includes an attribute for which filtering is not supported, it MAY be ignored by the service.

#### Filtering Security Considerations

When defining query parameters, privacy and security constraints MUST be considered to prevent sensitive information from being revealed through filtering. For example, it SHOULD NOT be possible to filter using personal information such as name, phone number, or IP address.

#### Filtering operations

**Filtering Operations**
=====================

| **Operation**     | 	Numbers                     | 	Dates                                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Equal             | `GET .../?amount=807.24`	    | `GET .../?executionDate=2024-02-05T09:38:24Z` |
| Greater or equal	 | `GET .../?amount.gte=807.24` | `GET.../?executionDate.gte=2018-05-30`        |
| Strictly greater  | `GET .../?amount.gt=807.24`  | `GET.../?executionDate.gt=2018-05-30`         |
| Smaller or equal	 | `GET .../?amount.lte=807.24` | `GET.../?executionDate.lte=2018-05-30`        |
| Strictly smaller  | `GET .../?amount.lt=807.24`  | `GET.../?executionDate.lt=2018-05-30`         |

**Filtering on Strings/Enums**
-----------------------------

| **Operation** |	**Strings/enums** |
| ----- | ----- |
| Equal | `GET .../?type=mobile` |
| Non-equal | `GET .../?type!=mobile` |
| Contains | `GET .../?type=~str` |

**Filtering on Boolean Parameters**
---------------------------------

| **Operation** | 	**Booleans**    |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| True          | `GET .../?boolAttr=true`  |
| False         | `GET .../?boolAttr=false` |

**Additional Rules**
-------------------

* The operator "`&`" is evaluated as an AND between different attributes.
* A Query Param (attribute) can contain one or n values separated by "`,`".
* For operations on numeric, date or enumerated fields, the parameters with the suffixes `.(gte|gt|lte|lt)$` MUST be defined, which SHOULD be used as comparators for “greater—equal to, greater than, smaller—equal to, smaller than” respectively. Only the parameters REQUIRED for the given field SHOULD be defined, e.g., with `.gte` and `.lte` suffixes only.

**Examples**
------------

* <u>Equals</u>: to search devices with a particular operating system and version or type:
  - `GET /device?os=ios&version=17.0.1`
  - `GET /device?type=apple,android`
    - Search for several values separating them by "`,`".
* <u>Inclusion</u>: if we already have a filter that searches for "equal" and we want to provide it with the possibility of searching for "inclusion", we MUST include the character "~"
  - `GET /device?version=17.0.1`
    - Search for the exact version "17.0.1"
  - `GET /device?version=~17.0`
    - Look for version strings that include "17.0"
* <u>Greater than / less than</u>: new attributes MUST be created with the suffixes `.(gte|gt|lte|lt)$` and included in `get` operation:

```yaml
paths:
  /users:
    get:  
      parameters:
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/StartCreationDate"
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/AfterCreationDate"
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/EndCreationDate"
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/BeforeCreationDate"
    #...
components:
  parameters: 
    StartCreationDate:   #<-- component name
      in: query
      name: creationDate.gte    <-- query attribute for "greater - equal to" comparison 
      required: false
      schema:
        format: date-time
        type: string
    AfterCreationDate:
      in: query
      name: creationDate.gt
      required: false
      schema:
        format: date-time
        type: string
    EndCreationDate:
      in: query
      name: creationDate.lte
      required: false
      schema:
        format: date-time
        type: string
    BeforeCreationDate:
      in: query
      name: creationDate.lt
      required: false
      schema:
        format: date-time
        type: string
```

Then the parameters can be included in the query:
  - `GET /users?creationDate.gte=2021-01-01T00:00:00`
    - Find users with creationDate starting from 2021
  - `GET /users?creationDate.lt=2022-01-01T00:00:00`
    - Find users with creationDate before 2022
  - `GET /users?creationDate.gte=2020-01-01T00:00:00&creationDate.lte=2021-12-31T23:59:59`
    - Search for users created between 2020 and 2021

## Security

# Good Practices to Secure REST APIs

The following points serve as a checklist for designing the security mechanism of REST APIs.

## 1. Simple and Targeted Security

Securing only the APIs that require security is essential. Implementing overly complex solutions can inadvertently create vulnerabilities. Prioritize simplicity and focus on securing only the necessary APIs.

## 2. Mandatory Use of HTTPS

TLS is a MUST for ensuring the confidentiality of transported data and verifying the server's hostname matches the SSL certificate. When using HTTP/2 to improve performance, sending multiple requests over a single connection can reduce the overhead of TCP and SSL on subsequent requests.

## 3. Secure Password Storage

Passwords MUST NOT be sent in API bodies. If password transmission is unavoidable, they MUST be hashed to protect the system from compromise in the event of hacking attempts. Effective hashing algorithms include PBKDF2, bcrypt, and scrypt.

## 4. Avoid Exposing Sensitive Information in URLs

Usernames, passwords, session tokens, and API keys SHOULD NOT appear in URLs, as they can be captured in web server logs, making them easily exploitable. For example, the URL `https://api.domain.com/user-management/users/{id}/someAction?apiKey=abcd123456789` exposes the API key. This approach is NOT RECOMMENDED.

## 5. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization protocols and flows, as described in the [Camara Security and Interoperability Profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-Security-Interoperability.md), MUST be considered.

## 6. Request Time Flags

Adding a request timestamp as a custom HTTP header in API requests is RECOMMENDED. The server SHOULD compare the current timestamp with the request timestamp and only accept the request if it is within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 1-2 minutes). This helps prevent basic replay attacks.

## 7. Entry Params Validation

Validate request parameters in the first step before reaching application logic. Implement strong validation checks and reject the request immediately if validation fails. In the API response, send relevant error messages and an example of the correct input format to improve user experience.

### Security definition

All APIs MUST be secured to ensure that access is restricted to authorized parties and that access is granted for a specific purpose. 
CAMARA employs OIDC and CIBA for authentication and consent collection to determine whether a user has opted out of certain API access.

The [Camara Security and Interoperability Profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-Security-Interoperability.md#purpose) dictates that a single purpose is encoded in the list of scope values. The purpose values are defined by the W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary, as outlined in the [Profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-Security-Interoperability.md#purpose-as-a-scope).

### Expressing Security Requirements

Security requirements of an API are expressed in OpenAPI through [Security Requirement Objects](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#security-requirement-object).

The following is an example of how to use the `openId` security scheme, as described in [Use of security property](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#use-of-security-property):

```yaml
paths:
  {path}:
    {method}:
      ...
      security:
        - openId:
            - {scope}
```

The name `openId` MUST be the same as defined in the `components.securitySchemes` section.

### Mandatory template for `info.description` in CAMARA API specs

The documentation template available in [CAMARA API Specification - Authorization and authentication common guidelines](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#mandatory-template-for-infodescription-in-camara-api-specs) SHALL be used as part of the authorization and authentication API documentation in the `info.description` property of the CAMARA API specs.

### POST or GET for transferring sensitive or complex data

Using the GET operation to pass sensitive data can potentially embed this information in the URL, if contained in query or path parameters. This can lead to the sensitive data being visible to anyone who can read the URL, or being logged by elements along the route, such as gateways and load balancers. As a result, there is an increased risk that the sensitive data may be acquired by unauthorized third parties.

Using HTTPS does not mitigate this vulnerability, as the TLS termination points are not necessarily the same as the API endpoints themselves.

The classification of data tagged as sensitive should be assessed for each API project. Examples of sensitive data include:

* Phone numbers (MSISDN) MUST be handled cautiously, as it is not solely about the number itself, but also knowing something about the transactions being processed for that customer.
* Localization information (such as latitude & longitude) associated with a device identifier, which allows the device, and hence customer, location to be known.
* Physical device identifiers, such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, or IMEI.

In such cases, it is RECOMMENDED to use one of the following methods to transfer the sensitive data:

* When using GET, transfer the data using headers, which are not routinely logged or cached.
* Use POST instead of GET, with the sensitive data being embedded in the request body, which is also not routinely logged or cached.

When using the POST method:

* The resource in the path MUST be a verb (e.g., `retrieve-location` and not `location`) to differentiate from an actual resource creation.
* The request body itself MUST be a JSON object and MUST be REQUIRED, even if all properties are optional.

It is also acceptable to use POST instead of GET:

* To bypass technical limitations, such as URL character limits (if longer than 4k characters) or passing complex objects in the request.
* For operations where the response should not be kept cached, such as anti-fraud verifications or data that can change asynchronously (such as status information).

### Scope naming



#### APIs which do not deal with explicit subscriptions

Regarding scope naming for APIs that do not deal with explicit subscriptions, the guidelines are as follows:

* Define a scope per API operation with the structure `api-name:[resource:]action`, where:
	+ `api-name` is the API name specified as the base path, prior to the API version, in the `servers[*].url` property. For example, from `/location-verification/v0`, it would be `location-verification`.
	+ `resource` is optional. For APIs with several `paths`, it may include the resource in the path. For example, from `/qod/v0/sessions/{sessionId}`, it would be `sessions`.
	+ `action`: There are two cases:
		- For POST operations with a verb, it will be the verb. For example, from `POST /location-verification/v0/verify`, it would be `verify`.
		- For endpoints designed as POST but with underlying logic retrieving information, a CRUD action `read` may be added. However, if it is a path with a single operation, and it is not expected to have more operations on it, the CRUD action is not necessary.
		- For CRUD operations on a resource in paths, it will be one of:
			- `create`: For operations creating the resource, typically `POST`.
			- `read`: For operations accessing details of the resource, typically `GET`.
			- `update`: For operations modifying the resource, typically `PUT` or `PATCH`.
			- `delete`: For operations removing the resource, typically `DELETE`.
			- `write`: For operations creating or modifying the resource, when differentiation between `create` and `update` is not needed.

MAY be necessary to add a level to the scope, such as `api-name:[resource:]action[:detail]`, to deal with cases where only a set of parameters/information has to be allowed to be returned. Guidelines SHOULD be enhanced when those cases occur.

##### Examples

| API                   | path          | method | scope                                             |
|-----------------------|---------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Location Verification | `/verify`     | POST   | `location-verification:verify`                    |
| QoD Sessions          | `/sessions`   | POST   | `qod:sessions:create`, or<br> `qod:sessions:write` |
| QoD QoS Profiles      | `/qos-profiles`| GET    | `qod:qos-profiles:read`                           |

#### API-level scopes (sometimes referred to as wildcard scopes in CAMARA)

The decision on API-level scopes was made within the [Identity and Consent Management Working Group](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement) and is documented in the design guidelines to ensure the completeness of this document.

API-level scopes MUST be those defined in the API Specs YAML files. A scope SHALL provide access to all endpoints and resources of an API ONLY if it is explicitly defined in the API Spec YAML file and agreed in the corresponding API subproject.

## OAS Sections



### Reserved words

To avoid issues with implementation using Open API generators, reserved words MUST NOT be used in the following parts of an API specification:

* Path and operation names
* Path or query parameter names
* Request and response body property names
* Security schemes
* Component names
* OperationIds

A reserved word is one whose usage is reserved by any of the Open API generators listed below. Refer to the respective documentation for a comprehensive list of reserved words:

* [Python Flask](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/python-flask/#reserved-words)
* [OpenAPI Generator (Java)](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/java/#reserved-words)
* [OpenAPI Generator (Go)](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/go/#reserved-words)
* [OpenAPI Generator (Kotlin)](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/kotlin/#reserved-words)
* [OpenAPI Generator (Swift5)](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/swift5#reserved-words)

### OpenAPI Version

The API functionalities MUST be implemented in accordance with the specifications outlined in the [Open API version 3.0.3](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3). The API definition file MUST be named `api-name` and MUST have a `.yaml` or `.json` file extension.

### Info Object

The `info` object SHALL have the following content:

```yaml
info:
  # REQUIRED title without "API" in it, e.g. "Number Verification"
  title: Number Verification
  # REQUIRED description explaining the API, part of the API documentation
  # text explaining how to fill the "Authorization and authentication" - see section 11.6
  description: |
    This API allows to verify that the provided mobile phone number is the one used in the device. It
    verifies that the user is using a device with the same mobile phone number as it is declared.
    ### Authorization and authentication
    CAMARA guidelines define a set of authorization flows ...
  # REQUIRED API version - Aligned to SemVer 2.0 according to CAMARA versioning guidelines
  version: 1.0.1
  # REQUIRED Name of the license and a URL to the license description
  license:
    name: Apache 2.0
    url: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html
  # REQUIRED CAMARA Commonalities minor version - x.y
  x-camara-commonalities: 0.5
```

The `termsOfService` and `contact` fields MAY be added by API Providers documenting their APIs.

The extension field `x-camara-commonalities` indicates the minor version of CAMARA Commonalities guidelines that the given API specification adheres to.

An example of the `info` object is shown below:

```yaml
info:
  title: Number Verification
  description: |
    This API allows to verify that the provided mobile phone number is the one used in the device. It
    verifies that the user is using a device with the same mobile phone number as it is declared.
  version: 1.0.1
  license:
    name: Apache 2.0
    url: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html
  x-camara-commonalities: 0.4.0
```

#### Title

**Data Retrieval Service**
=========================

The Data Retrieval Service is a RESTful interface that enables clients to fetch data from a centralized repository. The service is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to use.

### Service Endpoints

The Data Retrieval Service exposes the following endpoints:

*   `GET /data/{id}`: Retrieves data by ID.
*   `GET /data/{id}/metadata`: Retrieves metadata associated with the data by ID.
*   `GET /data`: Retrieves a list of all available data.
*   `GET /data/{id}/history`: Retrieves a list of revisions for the data by ID.

### Request and Response Formats

The Data Retrieval Service supports JSON and XML formats for requests and responses.

### Authentication

The Data Retrieval Service uses token-based authentication. Clients MUST provide a valid token in the `Authorization` header to access the service.

### Error Handling

The Data Retrieval Service returns HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of a request. Clients SHOULD check the status code and handle errors accordingly.

### Rate Limiting

The Data Retrieval Service implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Clients SHOULD NOT exceed the maximum allowed requests per minute. If the limit is exceeded, the service SHALL return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

### Data Formats

The Data Retrieval Service supports various data formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML. Clients MAY specify the desired format in the `Accept` header.

### Data Retrieval Service Requirements

The Data Retrieval Service SHALL meet the following requirements:

*   MUST support JSON and XML formats for requests and responses.
*   MUST implement token-based authentication.
*   SHOULD return HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of a request.
*   MAY support rate limiting to prevent abuse.
*   MAY support various data formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML.

#### Description

No special restrictions are specified in CAMARA.

#### Version

APIs SHALL use the [versioning-format](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/3yLe) as specified by the Release Management Working Group.

#### Terms of service

API providers MAY include terms of service in their API documentation.

#### Contact information

Contact information MAY be included, but it is NOT RECOMMENDED. API providers MAY add this content when documenting their APIs.

#### License

The license object SHALL include the following fields:

```
license
  name: Apache 2.0
  url: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html
```

#### Extension field

The API SHALL specify the commonalities release number it is compliant to by including the `x-camara-commonalities` extension field.

### Servers object

The `servers` object SHALL have the following content:

```yaml
servers:
  # apiRoot variable and the fixed base path containing <api-name> and <api-version> as defined in chapter 5  
  - url: {apiRoot}/quality-on-demand/v2
    variables:
      apiRoot:
        default: http://localhost:9091
        description: API root, defined by the service provider, e.g. `api.example.com` or `api.example.com/somepath`
```

If more than one server object instance is listed, the `servers[*].url` property of each instance MUST have the same string for the `<api-name>` and `<api-version>` placeholders.

The servers object SHALL have the following content:

```
servers:
  - url: {apiRoot}/<api-name>/<api-version>
    variables:
      apiRoot:
        default: http://localhost:9091
        description: API root, defined by the service provider, e.g. `api.example.com` or `api.example.com/somepath`
```

#### API-Name

The `API-Name` is specified as the base path, prior to the API version, in the `servers[*].url` property. If multiple `server` object instances are listed, each `servers[*].url` property MUST have the same string for the API name and version in the respective instance.

For example, in the following case, the `API-Name` would be `location-verification`.
```
/location-verification/v0
```

Note: I corrected the spelling of "API-Name" to "API-Name" (with a hyphen) to match the correct terminology. I also replaced the HTML line break (`</br>`) with a standard Markdown line break (`\n`).

#### API-Version

API-Version SHALL be the same as the [Version](#version) in the info object.

#### Headers



##### Content-Type Header

The character set supported MUST only be UTF-8. According to the [JSON Data Interchange Format (RFC 8259)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-8.1), it is specified that:

```
JSON text exchanged between systems that are not part of a closed
ecosystem MUST be encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629].

Previous specifications of JSON have not REQUIRED the use of UTF-8
when transmitting JSON text.  However, the vast majority of JSON-
based software implementations have chosen to use the UTF-8 encoding,
to the extent that it is the ONLY encoding that achieves
interoperability.
```

Implementers MAY include the UTF-8 character set in the Content-Type header value, for example, "application/json; charset=utf-8". However, the preferred format is to specify only the MIME type, such as "application/json". Regardless, the interpretation of the MIME type as UTF-8 is MANDATORY, even when only "application/json" is provided.

##### X-correlator Header

With the aim of standardizing the request observability and traceability process, common headers that provide a follow-up of the E2E processes should be included. The table below captures these headers.

| Name           | Description                                   | Schema          | Location         | Required by API Consumer | Required in OAS Definition | 	Example                              | 
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `x-correlator` | 	Service correlator to make E2E observability | `type: string`  `pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,55}$`     | Request / Response | No                       | Yes                        | 	b4333c46-49c0-4f62-80d7-f0ef930f1c46 |

When the API Consumer includes a non-empty "x-correlator" header in the request, the API Provider **MUST** include it in the response with the same value that was used in the request. Otherwise, the "x-correlator" header in the response is **OPTIONAL**, but it is **RECOMMENDED** to use a UUID for the value.

In notification scenarios (i.e., POST requests sent towards the listener indicated by `sink` address), the use of the "x-correlator" is supported for the same aim. When the API request includes the "x-correlator" header, it is **RECOMMENDED** for the listener to include it in the response with the same value as was used in the request. Otherwise, the "x-correlator" header in the response is **OPTIONAL**, and any valid value **MAY** be used.

NOTE: HTTP headers are case-insensitive. The use of the naming `x-correlator` is a guideline to align the format across CAMARA APIs.

#### Security schemes

Security schemes in OpenAPI express security configurations for APIs. Security can be applied to the API as a whole or to individual endpoints.

As specified in [Use of openIdConnect for securitySchemes](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#use-of-openidconnect-for-securityschemes), all CAMARA OpenAPI files MUST include the following scheme definition in their components section, with an adapted `openIdConnectUrl`. The schema definition is repeated here for illustration purposes; the correct format MUST be obtained from the linked document.

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    openId:
      type: openIdConnect
      openIdConnectUrl: https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

The key of the security scheme is arbitrary in OAS, but it is RECOMMENDED to name it `openId` in CAMARA for convention.

## Appendix A (Normative): `info.description` template for when User identification can be from either an access token or explicit identifier

When an API requires a User (as defined by the [ICM Glossary](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#glossary-of-terms-and-concepts)) to be identified in order to access their data (as Resource Owner), the User can be identified in one of two ways:

- If the access token is a Three-Legged Access Token, the User will already have been associated with that token by the API provider, which may be identified from the physical device that calls the `/authorize` endpoint for the OIDC authorization code flow, or from the `login_hint` parameter of the OIDC CIBA flow (which can be a device IP, phone number or operator token). The `sub` claim of the ID token returned with the access token confirms that an association with the User has been made, although this does not directly identify the User, given that the `sub` is not a globally unique identifier and does not contain PII, as per the [CAMARA Security and Interoperability Profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-Security-Interoperability.md#id-token-sub-claim) requirements.
- If the access token is a Two-Legged Access Token, no User is associated with the token, and an explicit identifier MUST be provided. This is typically either a `Device` object named `device`, or a `PhoneNumber` string named `phoneNumber`. Both of these schemas are defined in the [CAMARA_common.yaml](/artifacts/CAMARA_common.yaml) artifact. In both cases, it is the User being identified, although the `device` identifier allows this indirectly by identifying an active physical device.

If an API provider issues Three-Legged Access Tokens for use with the API, the following error may occur:

- **Both a Three-Legged Access Token and an explicit User identifier (device or phone number) are provided by the API consumer.**

  Whilst it might be considered harmless to proceed if both identify the same User, returning an error only when the two do not match would allow the API consumer to confirm the identity of the User associated with the access token, which they might otherwise not know. Although this functionality is supported by some APIs (e.g. Number Verification, KYC Match), for others it may exceed the scope consented to by the User.

  If the API scope DOES NOT allow explicit confirmation as to whether the identifiers match, a `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error MUST be returned, regardless of whether the identifiers match or not.

  If the API scope DOES allow explicit confirmation as to whether the identifiers match, a `403 INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT` error MUST be returned if the identifiers do not match and the mismatch is not indicated using some other mechanism (e.g. as an explicit field in the API response body).

If an API provider issues Two-Legged Access Tokens for use with the API, the following error may occur:

- **Neither a Three-legged Access Token nor an explicit User identifier (device or phone number) are provided by the API consumer.**

  One or other MUST be provided to identify the User.

  In this case, a `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code MUST be returned, indicating that the API provider cannot identify the User from the provided information.

The documentation template below is RECOMMENDED to be used as part of the `info.description` API documentation to explain to the API consumer how the pattern works.

This template is applicable to CAMARA APIs that:

- require the User (i.e. Resource Owner) to be identified; 
- may have implementations that accept Two-Legged Access Tokens; 
- do NOT allow the API to confirm whether or not the optional User identifier (`device` or `phoneNumber`) matches that associated with the Three-Legged Access Token.

The template SHOULD be customised for each API using it by deleting one of the options where marked (*).

# Identifying the [ device | phone number ](*) from the access token

This API requires the API consumer to identify a device or phone number as the subject of the API as follows:

- When invoking the API with a two-legged access token, the subject MUST be identified from the optional `device` object or `phoneNumber` field, which MUST be provided.
- When using a three-legged access token, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information associated with the access token, which was identified during the authentication process.

## Error handling:

- If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object or `phoneNumber` field is not present in the request, the server SHALL return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

- If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object or `phoneNumber` field is also included in the request, the server SHALL return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This SHALL occur even if the same device or phone number is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.
