    Device:
      description: |
        End-user equipment able to connect to a mobile network. Examples of devices include smartphones or IoT sensors/actuators.
            The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:
            * `ipv4Address`
            * `ipv6Address`
            * `phoneNumber`
            * `networkAccessIdentifier`
            NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.
            NOTE2: as for this Commonalities release, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

    DeviceResponse:
      description: |
        An identifier for the end-user equipment able to connect to the network that the response refers to. This parameter is only returned when the API consumer includes the `device` parameter in their request (i.e. they are using a two-legged access token), and is relevant when more than one device identifier is specified, as only one of those device identifiers is allowed in the response.

        If the API consumer provides more than one device identifier in their request, and this schema is included in the response definition, the API provider MUST use it to return a single identifier which is the one they are using to fulfil the request, even if the identifiers do not match the same device. API provider does not perform any logic to validate/correlate that the indicated device identifiers match the same device. No error should be returned if the identifiers are otherwise valid to prevent API consumers correlating different identifiers with a given end user.

    PhoneNumber:
      description: A public identifier addressing a telephone subscription. In mobile networks it corresponds to the MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number). In order to be globally unique it has to be formatted in international format, according to E.164 standard, prefixed with '+'.
      type: string

      example: "+123456789"

    NetworkAccessIdentifier:
      description: A public identifier addressing a subscription in a mobile network. In 3GPP terminology, it corresponds to the GPSI formatted with the External Identifier ({Local Identifier}@{Domain Identifier}). Unlike the telephone number, the network access identifier is not subjected to portability ruling in force, and is individually managed by each operator.
      type: string
      example: "123456789@example.com"

    DeviceIpv4Address:
      type: object
      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.

# ERROR RESPONSE SCHEMA TEMPLATE
#   - Objective: Make normative error `status` and `code` values
#   - Schema Template rationale:
#     - The `allOf` in content.application/json.schema allows a combination of both the generic ErrorInfo schema and the specific schema for this error response,
#       which validates that `status` and `code` have only the specified values.
#       This `allOf` is used without discriminator because it does not imply any hierarchy between the models, just 2 schemas that must be independently validated.
